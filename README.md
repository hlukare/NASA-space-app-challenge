## 📌 Problem Statement

> **🌐 Challenge Theme:** *How do gender and climate influence each other?*

### 🧩 The Issue

Climate change is one of the most pressing global challenges of our time — but its impacts are **not gender-neutral**. Social roles, economic disparities, and cultural norms create unequal exposure and vulnerability to climate hazards between genders.

Women and marginalized genders, particularly in developing regions, often:

- Have **limited access to resources** like land, technology, and credit.
- Are **underrepresented in decision-making** bodies and climate policymaking.
- Bear the **burden of caregiving and resource collection**, which becomes harder during droughts, floods, or extreme weather.
- Face **increased risks of displacement, poverty, and violence** due to climate-induced crises.

Meanwhile, women also play a critical role as **agents of change** — driving sustainable practices, community resilience, and eco-entrepreneurship.

---

### 🎯 Project Goal

To **build a digital platform** that highlights this intersection — showcasing how gender dynamics and climate change affect each other through:

- **Interactive visualizations** that display data and trends across regions and years.  
- **Case studies and narratives** to bring lived experiences to light.  
- **Educational content** to drive awareness and inclusivity in climate action.  
- **Actionable recommendations** for communities, NGOs, and policymakers.

By raising awareness and making this complex issue accessible, we hope to **empower people to create gender-responsive climate strategies** that leave no one behind.

---

### 🧭 Objectives

- 🔍 Visualize the disparities in climate impact across gender groups.  
- 💬 Educate users about the systemic inequalities that amplify climate risks.  
- 📢 Amplify voices of women and communities leading climate resilience efforts.  
- 🚀 Encourage data-driven and inclusive climate action.

> This project aligns with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):  
> **#5 Gender Equality** and **#13 Climate Action**.
